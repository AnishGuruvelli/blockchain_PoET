## LAND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM : PoET Algorithm
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a consensus algorithm developed by Intel Corporation that enables permissioned blockchain networks to determine who creates the next block.
<br/>
PoET follows a lottery system that spreads the chances of winning equally across network participants, giving every node the same chance.
<br/>
The PoET algorithm generates a random wait time for each node in the blockchain network; each node must sleep for that duration.
<br/>
The node with the shortest wait time will wake up first and win the block, thus being allowed to commit a new block to the blockchain.
<br/>
The PoET workflow is similar to Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) but consumes less power because it allows a node to sleep and switch to other tasks for the specified time, thereby increasing network energy efficiency.
<br/>
Proof of elapsed time uses much less energy than proof of work since it randomly selects a node instead of using all the miners on a network in a competition.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

You buy a piece of land. Someone else claims to own the land. But the one who sold you the land
showed you the paperwork. The land registry office earlier said that the owner was rightful. Now
they say that they made a mistake – it was owned by the other person. You already paid for the
land – to the first person. The First person goes missing, how does anyone prove who changed
the land record?
